# 🏗 System Architecture

```
User (Browser)
      ↓
React Frontend
      ↓
REST API (Spring Boot / Node.js)
      ↓
Database (MySQL / MongoDB)
```

### Flow Explanation

1. User performs action in UI.
2. Frontend sends HTTP request via Axios.
3. Backend processes request.
4. Database stores/retrieves data.
5. Response returned to frontend.
6. UI updates dynamically.

# 🔒 Security Best Practices Implemented

- Sensitive data stored in `.env` files
- `.env` added to `.gitignore`
- No API keys pushed to GitHub
- Passwords not hardcoded
- Backend credentials externalized
- Clean commit history

---

# 🗄 Database Design (Example Structure)

## Users Table
- id
- name
- email
- password
- created_at

## Expenses Table
- id
- user_id
- amount
- category
- date
- description

## Loans Table
- id
- user_id
- income
- credit_score
- eligibility_status

---

# 🔌 API Endpoints (Example)

## Authentication
POST /api/auth/register  
POST /api/auth/login  

## Expenses
GET /api/expenses  
POST /api/expenses  
PUT /api/expenses/{id}  
DELETE /api/expenses/{id}  

## Loan Prediction
POST /api/loan/check

# ⚙ Installation & Setup Guide

## 1️⃣ Clone Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/Annshikaa/FinLoan-AI.git
cd FinLoan-AI
```

---

## 2️⃣ Backend Setup

Navigate to backend:

```
cd backend
```

For Spring Boot:

```
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```

For Node.js:

```
npm install
npm start
```

Backend runs on:
```
http://localhost:8080
```

---

## 3️⃣ Frontend Setup

Navigate to frontend:

```
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

Frontend runs on:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

---

# 🔑 Environment Variables Setup

Create a `.env` file inside frontend:

```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
REACT_APP_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
```

For backend (Spring Boot example):

Use environment variables instead of hardcoding:

```
spring.datasource.password=${DB_PASSWORD}
```

Never push `.env` or `application.properties` with real credentials.
